<h2><a name="Getting_Started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Help Generator is designed to generate source-code documentation for
programs written in Object Pascal.&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.borland.com/">Delphi</a>, <a
 href="http://www.borland.com/">Kylix</a>, and <a
 href="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/">Lazarus</a> are all used to
create programs with Object Pascal.&nbsp; If you are writing
components, or open-source programs with one of those IDE's, Help
Generator can help you create documentation for your project.&nbsp; It
is also useful for create documentation for your program for your own
internal use.
</p>
<p>As you will see, Help Generator is not intended to provide
documentation for users of closed-source programs.&nbsp; If that is
what you want to do, there are many other programs you can use for
that purpose.
</p>
<p>To use Help Generator, you need to insert comments in the <code><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">interface</span></code> section of your
source code files.&nbsp; Generally the comments must immediately
precede the item that they document.&nbsp; Help Generator extracts
those comments and creates the documentation from them.&nbsp; The
documentation can be either a series of web pages, an html-help project
or a <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> file.&nbsp;
With a Latex file you can create files in other formats such as PDF, or
Rich-Text format (rtf).&nbsp; (See <a
 href="http://www.texniccenter.org/front_content.php">TeXnicCenter</a>
and <a href="http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/">Latex2Rtf</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>In your source-code comments, you can use a number of special tags
to create cross-links or to control the appearance of the generated
documentation.&nbsp; The supported tags are documented at <a
 href="http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/SupportedTags">http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/SupportedTags</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Once you have put the comments in your source code, you are ready to
run to Help Generator.&nbsp; The most important things you need to do
are to<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>choose the source code files to include, and</li>
  <li>choose the output type.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have done that, you are ready to go to the Generate tab,
and generate the documentation.&nbsp; However, there are a few more
things that you might want to do to customize your documentation.&nbsp;
The remainder of this page describes those options.<br>
</p>
<p>You can save your settings for a project by selecting
"File|Save".&nbsp; Later on you can retrieve the projecting settings
again by selecting "File|Open".<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Source_Files_Tab"></a>Source Files Tab</h2>
<p>Enter the names of the source code files that you want Help
Generator to process here or click the Browse button and select them.</p>
<h2><a name="Options_Tab"></a>Options Tab</h2>
<h3><a name="Project_Name"></a>Project Name<br>
</h3>
<p>The Project Name is used to help determine the name of the output
file or files.&nbsp; For example if the project name is "MyDoc" and the
output type is LaTeX, the LaTeX file that is generated would be
MyDoc.tex.</p>
<h3><a name="Language"></a>Language</h3>
<p>There are a number of places where Help Generator writes predefined
phrases such as "All Units" in the documentation.&nbsp; Those phrases
have been translated into a variety of languages.&nbsp; To ensure that
the language for those phrases matches the language used in the
comments, choose the correct language</p>
<h3><a name="Properties_Methods_Events_and_Fields"></a>Properties,
Methods, Events, and Fields to Include</h3>
<p>These check boxes controls which properties, methods, events, and
fields to include based on their visibility.&nbsp; For example, if you
are documenting a component, you might want to include only the
published and public properties because those are the ones to which the
users of the component will have access.&nbsp; However, it would still
be easy to generate another version of the documentation for your own
use that included the protected and private properties, methods,
events, and fields as well.<br>
</p>
<p>"Implicit" means the fields at the beginning of a class declaration
before any visibility specifier.&nbsp; "Implicit" fields will be either
public or published depending on the {$M+} or {$M-} compiler option.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Title"></a>Title</h3>
<p>The Title is the title that will appear on the title page of the
LaTeX documentation or as the caption of the web browser <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="Message_Level"></a>Message Level</h3>
<p>When Help Generator is creating the documentation, a number of
informative messages are generated.&nbsp; Some are error messages or
warnings.&nbsp; Others are just informative messages.&nbsp; When the
Message Level is set to 1, only errors and warning messages will be
displayed.&nbsp; When the Message Level is set to 2, a message will be
shown for each source code file that is processed as well as errors and
warnings.&nbsp; As the Message Level increases to 6, the number of
informative messages increases.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Output_Type"></a>Output Type</h3>
<p>The Output Type determines whether the generated documentation will
be a series of web pages, an html-help project, an ordinary LaTeX file
or a LaTeX for use with Latex2Rtf.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Locations_Tab"></a>Locations Tab</h2>
<h3><a name="Output_Directory"></a>Output Directory</h3>
<p>The Output Directory is the location where the documentation should
be
created.&nbsp; If you don't specify the location, the directory
containing the first source code file you select will be chosen as the
location to create the documentation.&nbsp; If you specify a directory
that does not exist, Help Generator will try to create it for you.</p>
<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>If you want to include an introduction to your documentation, write
it in a text file and specify its location here. Help Generator can
process it in much the same way that it does source code files.</p>
<h3><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you want to include a conclusion to your documentation, write it
in a text file and specify its location here. Help Generator can
process it in much the same way that it does source code files<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Browser_Location"></a>Browser Location</h3>
This is the location of the web browser that you prefer to use for
viewing web pages generated by Help Generator.&nbsp; If left blank, the
default browser for your computer will be used.<br>
<h3><a name="Pasdoc_Consol_Location"></a>Pasdoc Consol Location</h3>
This is the location of the consol program <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pasdoc.exe</span>.&nbsp; Pasdoc.exe is
included with Help Generator.&nbsp; It is Pasdoc that actually creates
the documentation for your source code files.<br>
<h3><a name="Html_Help_Contents_File"></a>Html Help Contents File</h3>
If you are creating a Html Help file, you can specy the Html Help
Contents File to use with the Html Help Project.&nbsp; If you don't
specify it, Help Generator will create a default one for you.<br>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="Web_Options_Tab"></a>Web Options Tab<br>
</h2>
<h3><a name="Header"></a>Header</h3>
<p>If you are creating a web page as your output, the "Header" text
will appear at the top of the web page.</p>
<h3><a name="Footer"></a>Footer</h3>
<p>If you are creating a web page as your output, the "Footer" text
will appear at the bottom of the web page.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Latex_Options"></a>Latex Options</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="Line_Breaks"></a>Line Breaks</h3>
<p>If you are generating LaTeX output, you can use this option to help
control the way line breaks are generated.&nbsp; If you choose the
"strict" option, TeX (the formatting engine for LaTeX files)&nbsp; may
extend a line past the normal page margin in order to prevent too many
spaces from appearing between words.&nbsp; If you choose the "sloppy"
option, Tex will prevent words from extending past the page margin even
if to do so it must insert too many spaces between words.</p>
<h3><a name="Hyph-en-at-ed_Words"></a>Hyph-en-at-ed Words</h3>
<p>
If you are generating LaTeX output, you can use this option to help
control the way line breaks are generated.&nbsp; Usually the reason
LaTeX has problems processing a line is that it contains a long word
near the end that it doesn't know how to hypenate.&nbsp; You can tell
it how to hypenate words by listing them here.&nbsp; Put hyphens in the
words wherever a hypen is allowed to appear.</p>
<h2><a name="GraphViz_Options_Tab"></a>GraphViz Options Tab</h2>
<h3><a name="GraphVizUses"></a>Create and Use GraphVizUses Diagram</h3>
<p>GraphViz is a a set of open-source programs for creating
diagrams.&nbsp; Help Generator can create an input file for the "dot"
program in GraphViz that shows how Object Pascal units use each
other.&nbsp; On Windows, Help Generator will run the "dot" program for
you if you
choose this option. On Linux, you must run dot yourself from the
command line.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: the images can get very <big style="font-weight: bold;">BIG</big>
so you may need to instruct users to set up their web browser's
preferences so that it does not automatically resize the figure.&nbsp;
Also sometimes the image that is generated might be too big to be
displayed properly in your web browser.&nbsp; If so, the image may
appear blank.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can get GraphViz from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="GraphVizClasses"></a>Create and use GraphViz Classes
diagram</h3>
<p>GraphViz is a a set of open-source programs for creating
diagrams.&nbsp;
Help Generator can create an input file for the "dot" program in
GraphViz that shows the class hierarchy in your program.&nbsp;&nbsp; On
Windows, Help Generator will run the "dot" program for you if you
choose this option. On Linux, you must run dot yourself from the
command line.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: the images can get very <big style="font-weight: bold;">BIG</big>
so you may need to instruct users to set up their web browser's
preferences so that it does not automatically resize the figure.&nbsp;
Also sometimes the image that is generated might be too big to be
displayed properly in your web browser.&nbsp; If so, the image may
appear
blank.</p>
<p>You can get GraphViz from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Location_of_GraphViz_Dot_Program"></a>Location of
GraphViz "Dot" Program</h3>
<p>If you chose either of the previous two options, you must tell Help
Generator where the "Dot" program is installed so Help Generator can
run Dot for you.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: the images can get very <big style="font-weight: bold;">BIG</big>
so you may need to instruct users to set up their web browser's
preferences so that it does not automatically resize the figure.&nbsp;
Also sometimes the image that is generated might be too big to be
displayed properly in your web browser.&nbsp; If so, the image may
appear
blank.</p>
<p>You can get GraphViz from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3>LaTeX Graphics Package</h3>
If you are generating LaTeX output and use graphics in it (such as the
graphics generated by GraphViz), you need to specify the LaTeX graphics
package to use.&nbsp; If you are planning to convert your LaTeX file to
a PDF, use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PDF </span>option.&nbsp;
If you are planning to convert it to a DVI file, use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DVI </span>option.&nbsp; If you are
planning to convert your LaTeX file to some other format, specify <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">None </span>and manually edit your LaTeX
to include the correct graphics package.<br>
<h3>Required program: GraphViz</h3>
This edit box gives the URL for GraphViz.&nbsp; You will need to
install GraphViz if you wish to use the GraphViz Uses or Classes
diagrams.<br>
<h2><a name="Spell_Checking_Tab"></a>Spell Checking Tab</h2>
<h3>Check Spelling</h3>
Checking this check box causes spell-checking to be activated.&nbsp;
Spell checking is done by the consol program ASpell.<br>
<h3>Language</h3>
Normally, you don't need to specify the language because it is
automatically selected for you.&nbsp; However, if the automatic
selection is incorrect, specify the correct language here.<br>
<h3>Words to Ignore</h3>
Frequently you will have words that ASpell doesn't recognize as correct
even though they are correct.&nbsp; Specify words that you want ASpell
to ignore here.&nbsp; Use one word per line.&nbsp; (Note, when you <a
 href="#Generate_Tab">generate documentation</a> with spell checking
activated, a list of all the misspelled words will be listed at the
bottom of the messages.&nbsp; You can copy that list here if all the
words in it are spelled correctly.)<br>
<h3>Required Program: ASpell</h3>
ASpell is the program that actually does the spell checking for
PasDoc.&nbsp; See <a
 href="http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/SpellChecking">http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/SpellChecking</a>
for more information.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Include_Directories_Tab"></a>Include Directories Tab</h2>
<p>If any of your source files include other files via the include
directive <span style="font-style: italic;">{$I AFile}</span>, list
the directories that have the include files here or click the Brows
button to select them.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Defines_Tab"></a>Defines Tab</h2>
<p>If any of your files uses compiler directives such as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">{$IFDEF AConstant}</span> to control
compilation, list the constants that are defined here.&nbsp; Help
Generator will use them to help parse your source code files.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Generate_Tab"></a>Generate Tab</h2>
<p>Click the Generate Documentation button to generate the
documentation for your project.&nbsp; Messages will appear in the memo
field above the button as the documentation is generated.&nbsp; If
spell checking is activated, a list of misspelled words will appear at
the end of the messages.<br>
